# Simple Bonita Example

This is a simple example of a process-centric application using Bonita. It represents a process for animal attendants to walk dogs at an animal shelter.

Note that this includes all the basic elements of a bonita workflow application - a data model, UI forms, and the underlying process model. Also note that it is a deliberately partial solution. In particular, most activities use the default form - with the exception of *Return Dog* activity, which has an example of a design UI form.

This also serves as an example of using github and Bonita together.

This was created for the IAB321 Business Process Technologies subject at QUT with Bonita 2023.2 u0 build 9.0.0.
